# BCIT-Embedded-PIC

I participated in all aspects of this project from programming the sounds and the LCD displays, to testing the interface as well as assembling the PICs and amplifiers. 

On the programming side, the sounds are generated by outputting electronic square waves at different frequencies. These waves are alternating zeros and ones with delays inserted in between. The LCD panel interacts with 3 additional toggle switches that allow the user to select between synthesizer modes such as Demo, SFX and Play.  

**Electronics parts used:**
 
- 2- 16F877 PICs, 
- 1- EB016-002 breadboard, 
- 1- EB005-00 LCD display, 
- 2- EB007-001 switch banks, 
- 3- Toggle switches, 
- 2- 3904 transistors, 
- 5- 1k ï€ resistors, 
- 2- 50 ohms speakers, 

**Troubleshooting:**

The program would stall when more than one mode switch was selected
> Created method to identify error states and stop the process of the program. An output indicates that only one switch can be selected at a time.

LCD bank operation was negatively affecting sound
>The LCD commands were programmed inside a loop that controlled the audio output. A second PIC was attached and programmed only for LCD operations. The 2 PICs interact and alternate operations.

Had to splice DB9 connectors to connect both switch banks to one port.
